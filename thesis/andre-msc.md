# Abstract

Over the last decades, scanning magnetic microscopy techniques have
been increasingly used in paleomagnetism and rock magnetism. Different
from standard paleomagnetic magnetometers, scanning magnetic microscopes
produce high-resolution maps of the vertical component of the magnetic
induction field on a plane located over the sample. These high-resolution
magnetic maps can be used for estimating the magnetization distribution
within a rock sample by inversion. Previous studies have estimated the
magnetization distribution within rock samples by inverting the magnetic
data measured on a plane above the sample. Here we present a new spacial
domain method for inverting the magnetic induction measured on four planes
around the sample in order to retrieve its internal magnetization
distribution. We have presumed that internal magnetization distribution
of the sample varies along one of its axes. Our method approximates the
sample geometry by an interpretation model composed of a one-dimensional
array of juxtaposed rectangular prisms with uniform magnetization. The
Cartesian components of the magnetization vector within each rectangular
prism are the parameters to be estimated by solving linear inverse problem.
Tests with synthetic data show the performance of our method in retrieving
complex magnetization distribution even in the presence of magnetization
heterogeneities. We have also applied our method to invert experimentally
measured magnetic data produced by a highly-magnetized synthetic sample that
was manufacturated in laboratory. The results show that, even in the
presence of apparent position noise, our method was able to retrieve
magnetization distribuition consistent with the anhysteretic remanence
magnetization induced in the sample.
